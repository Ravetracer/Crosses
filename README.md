Crosses
=======

This is a simple game, which I've developed in the 90s with Borland Pascal 7.

In order to compile it, you have to get a copy of Borland Pascal or you can try to get it run under Free Pascal.

If you just want to start the game, get DOSBox, configure it and just start "crosses.exe" to start the normal game with sound or "nosound.exe" which is compiled without sound support. This was sometimes necessary for early DOS emulators.

Have fun!
